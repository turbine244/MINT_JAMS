    "I can’t believe they are accusing Gordon of staging a mouse.  Just cause you have an exterminator coming , it doesn’t mean you will be 100% bug \u0026amp; vermin free.  They come in on boxes of food, trucks, walk in off the streets with the front door left ajar.  Mouse probably ate poison left out \u0026amp; wandered in the door.  It was dark \u0026amp; nobody noticed him til Gordon found him. The owner can’t get out of her own stupid way or embrace changes that actually work.  She is immature and doesn’t deserve this help.  I sure hope her staff finds bigger \u0026amp; better opportunities when this place closes up.",

    "@GordonRamsey I am your biggest fan if you see this comment i would like to here from you I am disappointing when Hell\u0026#39;s kitchen at lake Harveys opened when their original menu but after covid19 they no longer serve pizza they used have pizza i wish they brought it back but i was wandering next time you visit restaurant you could change it back i don\u0026#39;t know if Covid 19 restrictions they won\u0026#39;t put it back on the menu I am very disappointed when i went their first time it wasn\u0026#39;t a great experience because they ruined one of the life time this was the only restaurant in Nevada south lake Tahoe i hope you will fix it i know Message you on TIKTOK but they got rid of your account for some reason ity wasn\u0026#39;t you but hopefully you will fix it I would love to meet you one day I have always wanted to take a picture with you because i used wanted to be a chef when i grew up i have watch your show kitchen  nightmares",
    "Shelly doesn\u0026#39;t deserve ANYTHING. Her saying \u0026quot;absolutely not\u0026quot; to Gordon makes my blood boil. She needs nothing. Her mother and the rest of the gang deserve the renovation except for her. What an overly sensitive cockroach",
    "Post episode info: from the little information available online, Blackberry\u0026#39;s (the restaurant) closed in 2013. Shelly kept running the Blackberry\u0026#39;s name as a catering (side) business at least until 2019. The location is as of 2024 a bakery.",

    "Watch \u0026quot;Brennen Taylor.\u0026quot; He just made a video, revisiting a restaurant Gordan supposedly helped. He even speaks with the owners. A lot of \u0026quot;Kitchen Nightmare\u0026quot; videos are fabricated. It\u0026#39;s been confirmed a long time ago, though. I always knew it couldn\u0026#39;t be real.",
